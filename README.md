# Pattern Recognition

In this project there are different algorithims of pattern recognition, as the Euclidean distance classifier, the Bayesian statistic classifier or a complete OCR (Optical Character Recognition). 

All the code has been developed in Python through Jupyter Notebook.

First, the Euclidean distance classifier and the Bayesian statistic classifier that have been implemented throughout the duration of this first part are exposed. Another section corresponds to the regularization of the data, in which the algorithm used to carry out the regularization of the covariance matrices is exposed. The following section corresponds to the performance evaluation techniques that have been studied in the subject and their use to evaluate the classifiers previously implemented. Finally, a real case of shape recognition is presented, an OCR, which is implemented using one of the previously implemented classifiers and testing its accuracy in different scenarios.
